But have you set one yourself?</p>\n<p>Does the way you set goals helps you achieve them? If yes - then maybe you don’t need Aimily and you could share your success story and your personal know-how with us. But if you have tried many different things and still feel overwhelmed when you set a new goal, keep procrastinating and then become angry at yourself for not doing anything - then you are in the right place to be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-smart-goal-the-solution\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#is-smart-goal-the-solution\" aria-label=\"is smart goal the solution permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>❓Is SMART goal the solution❓</h2>\n<p>Just setting a SMART goal doesn’t guarantee you 100% success, and 2020 showed us how things might change and that we can’t control everything. But this is not a reason to just go with a flow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-smart-goal\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-smart-goal\" aria-label=\"why smart goal permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>❓Why SMART goal❓</h2>\n<p>Your brain needs to know the direction you want to head.</p>\n<p>The more <strong>SPECIFIC</strong> you are, the more details you include - the clearer guidelines your brain gets and starts looking for all the possibilities to make that thing you want to happen.</p>\n<p>You need to be clear with yourself as well - how will you <strong>MEASURE</strong> the result, how will you know that your goal is achieved?</p>\n<p>While we totally support the idea of dreaming big and believe that whatever you can imagine - the world has the capacity to deliver, to make things work for you faster and smoother we recommend setting an <strong>ATTAINABLE</strong> goal. Meaning that you already have some foundations, resources to start with.</p>\n<p><strong>RELEVANT.</strong> Ask yourself 5 WHYs: why do you want this? And whatever your first answer is - dig deeper - why do you want that? Repeat 5 times. Make sure this is something YOU want, not your friend, family, neighbour.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned, once your brain knows what to look for, while you are sleeping, working, walking, talking, your brain looks for the opportunities to make this happen. So if your goal is to buy a house, your brain might take it as - in this lifetime you want to buy a house and will relax for the next 10-20 years. But is it what you want? If you have an idea - whether it is 1 year or 5 years, make sure you write it down and make your goal <strong>TIME-BOUND</strong>, that way your brain will start working straight away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-aimily-helps-you-make-your-goal-smart\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-aimily-helps-you-make-your-goal-smart\" aria-label=\"how aimily helps you make your goal smart permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>❓How Aimily helps you make your goal SMART❓</h2>\n<p>We provide the questions you can ask yourself, a checklist and examples of most common goals - fitness, career, learning etc. If your goal is very unique and you need some help - check our **<a href=\"https://lu.ma/aimily.app\">workshop schedule**,</a> we will be happy to assist and provide guidance.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Set a SMART goal ","date":"2021-06-01","description":"# Set a SMART goalHow it works?: Specific.
